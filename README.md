## A recreation of my web-page portfolio created using Bootstrap code

The purpose of this exercise was to become farmiliar with Bootstrap and the methodologies required in its use

Initially I was skeptical, in part because using pre-written code felt like a shortcut but also, somewhat ironically, because learning Bootstrap meant an entire new "language" to learn. After some experimentation, however, I've come around to Bootstrap; Providing one knows the fundamental rules of its use, Bootstrap can make the process of creating relatively in-depth pages deceptively simple.

This project has been successful in my view, not to say I am an expert, but I do grasp the basics of how this language works and can utilize basic functions either from memory or by thinking logically about how other functions are structured and extrapolating from there.

Bootstraps built-in code meant I didn't need to implement any media queries myself.

**The classes used in the elements above set the width for each card at each screen size (S, M and L). Of course these needed tweaking to fit my design but it's an incredibly easy process.**

For the most part I found editing the look of Bootstrap elements fairly straightforward, usually just requiring quickly looking up the needed class for whatever needed editing, however certain edits took more trial and error than felt necessary, for example I struggled to simply change the colour of text once or twice; usually the mistake being a simple one, after realizing that the classes seem to only affect the exact element they're attributed to but not child elements there were very few issues.
